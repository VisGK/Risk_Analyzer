# Credit Risk Assessment using ML models

The project aims to develop a machine learning model to assess credit risk for loan applicants. By analyzing historical loan data, the model will predict the likelihood of default or delinquency for new applicants, helping financial institutions make more informed lending decisions.

## Datasets:
- **Lending Club Data**: Obtain historical loan data from Lending Club, a peer-to-peer lending platform. The dataset typically includes information on loan applicants, loan terms, credit scores, employment details, and loan performance (e.g., repayment status, defaults).
- 
[OpenIntro - Loans Full Schema Dataset](https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=loans_full_schema)


## Data Preparation:
- Merge and preprocess the datasets to create a unified dataset for analysis.
- Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
- Feature engineering: Extract relevant features such as debt-to-income ratio, loan-to-value ratio, and length of credit history.
- Encode categorical variables and normalize numerical features as needed.

## Machine Learning:
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Explore various machine learning algorithms suitable for classification tasks, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines.
- Train multiple models using the training data and evaluate their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or randomized search to optimize model performance.

## Model Interpretation:
- Use techniques like feature importance or SHAP values to interpret the model's decisions and understand the factors driving credit risk assessment.

## Documentation and Presentation:
- Document the data collection, preprocessing, and modeling steps in detail.
- Create a README.md file in your GitHub repository summarizing the project overview, dataset sources, methodology, and key findings.
- Prepare a presentation summarizing the project goals, methodology, model performance, and insights gained from the analysis. Consider visualizations and examples to illustrate your findings effectively.
